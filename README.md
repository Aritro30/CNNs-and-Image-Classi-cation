# CNNs-and-Image-Classification

In this assignment, we experiment with VGG-16 one of the most common 16-layer Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with approximately 138 million parameters. As part of the assignment we learn how to instantiate a CNN network, load pre-trained weights, train your own network for classication, use the network to classify images, and how to utilize pre-trained network to extract generic image features.
